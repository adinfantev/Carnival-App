# Carnival-App

Project: Udacity Carnival

My first repository on github for my first project in The VR Nanodegree Program.

So happy to have started the VR Nanodegree Program. Learning with lots of enthusiasm. Thrilled by the challenges this course offers to me.

Had to read the instructions and the project rubric very carefully and several times to get everythnig done for this project. Learned how to navigate in unity, modify an existing project and how to send the app to my android phone.

Added a big entrance/exit gate and some trees just to practice a bit and so that the scene didnÂ´t feel so empty.

The scene is located at: Assets/UdacityVR/Scenes/Project1

The following are the versions of Google VR SDK and Unity I used to make this project:

GVR_SDK_VERSION: 1.50.0

UNITY VERSION: 5.6.1p2 Personal
